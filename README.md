# PrivGuard Demo 🔐

PrivGuard is a simple log processing and anonymization tool.  
It parses raw log files, pseudonymizes sensitive data like user IDs and IPs, and generates clean reports for analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Parse raw log files
- Anonymize user data using pseudonymization
- Export results into:
  - `anonymized_logs.csv`
  - `mappings.json`
  - `privguard_report.html`
- Easy to extend with new log formats

## 📂 Project Structure
```

privguard-demo/
│── privguard.py         # Main script for log processing
│── sample\_logs.txt      # Example input log file

## ⚡ Usage
Run the tool with a sample log file:

```bash
python privguard.py sample_logs.txt
````

The results will be stored in the `output/` folder:

* `output/anonymized_logs.csv` → Anonymized log data
* `output/mappings.json` → Mapping between real and pseudonymized values
* `output/privguard_report.html` → Summary report

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* No external dependencies (pure Python)
  *(If you add extra libs later, update this section with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)*

## 📌 Example

Input (`sample_logs.txt`):

```
timestamp=2025-09-05T10:12:00 user=alice ip=192.168.0.5 action=login status=success
```

Output (`anonymized_logs.csv`):

```
timestamp,user,ip,action,status
2025-09-05T10:12:00,USR001,IP001,login,success
```
