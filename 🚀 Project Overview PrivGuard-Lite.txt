🚀 Project Overview: PrivGuard-Lite

Theme Fit: Cybersecurity vs Privacy: Balancing National Security and Individual Rights

This project demonstrates how security monitoring can be done without exposing private information of users, by anonymizing data with cryptographic pseudonyms.
It shows a practical middle ground:

Authorities can still detect threats (national security ✅)

Individuals’ personal info is hidden (privacy ✅).

🎯 Problem

Security teams need to analyze user activity logs to detect suspicious behavior (brute-force attacks, data exfiltration, odd login patterns, etc.).

But logs contain private data (usernames, IPs, devices) → If leaked, this becomes a privacy nightmare.

Challenge: How can we monitor activity without revealing sensitive identities?

💡 Solution: PrivGuard-Lite

A lightweight log analysis tool that:

Anonymizes usernames & IP addresses → using HMAC-SHA256 with a secret key.

Generates alerts for suspicious activity based on simple rules.

Produces a professional HTML report → with tables, colors, and graphs (Chart.js).

Balance:

Logs are pseudonymized → privacy protected.

Patterns/alerts are preserved → national security maintained.

⚙️ How it Works (Step-by-Step)
1. Input

A log file (sample_logs.txt) with entries like:

2025-09-05T01:23:45Z user=alice ip=192.168.0.1 action=login status=failed
2025-09-05T01:25:00Z user=alice ip=192.168.0.1 action=login status=success
2025-09-05T02:00:00Z user=charlie ip=10.0.0.5 action=upload size=500MB

2. Pseudonymization

Real alice → pseudonym USR_a1b2c3d4e5f6

Real 192.168.0.1 → pseudonym IP_9f8e7d6c5b4a

📌 Done using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) with a secret key (Browniee_2019).
This ensures only the system owner can consistently reproduce pseudonyms.

3. Rule-Based Detection

The system applies simple heuristics on the pseudonymized data:

Brute-force login attempts → 3+ failed logins within 10 mins.

Odd-hour login → successful login between midnight–4 AM.

IP hopping → user logs in from different IPs suddenly.

Large data transfers → download/upload > 100 MB.

Sensitive actions → e.g., password change, record deletion.

4. Output

The tool generates 3 outputs in the output/ folder:

CSV File (anonymized_logs.csv)
Stores logs with pseudonyms, no personal identifiers.

Mappings File (mappings.json)
Links real → pseudonym (kept secret, used only if legally required).

HTML Report (privguard_report.html)

Attractive UI (colors, tables).

Alerts clearly listed.

Bar Chart (via Chart.js) → shows distribution of alerts.

📊 Demo Report Features

Table: Timestamp | Alert Type | Pseudouser | Details

Graph: Alerts summary (Brute-force = 3, Large Transfer = 1, etc.)

Logs Table: Anonymized sample entries.

Notes Section: Explains pseudonymization + privacy-preserving design.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python → data parsing, pseudonymization, detection logic.

HMAC + SHA256 → cryptographic pseudonymization.

CSV + JSON → export structured results.

HTML + CSS + Chart.js → professional-looking final report.

🎯 Why this Project is Unique

Most hackathon projects just detect threats (security only ✅).

This project balances both security + privacy using real techniques (pseudonymization).

Simple enough to demo live → but conceptually strong (judges will love it).

🔑 Secret Key Purpose

Used for HMAC pseudonymization.

Ensures pseudonyms are:

Consistent → same user always gets same pseudonym.

Non-reversible → attackers cannot guess real identity from pseudonym.

Controlled → only you (system owner) can regenerate mappings.

👉 This is the bridge between national security (tracking) and privacy (hiding real names).

📌 Talking Points for Judges

“We anonymize logs with HMAC-SHA256 to preserve privacy.”

“Our detection engine still identifies suspicious activity without needing real names.”

“The HTML report gives both analysts and auditors a clear, privacy-compliant view.”

“This demo shows how we can balance security requirements with individual rights.”

✅ In summary:
PrivGuard-Lite = Log monitoring + Privacy by Design.
It’s a practical, innovative hackathon-ready project that hits the theme perfectly.
